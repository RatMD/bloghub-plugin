## 3. Blog Comments
Version 1.3.0 of our **BlogHub** plugin introduced a new comment environment with enhanced template 
components. The comment system is highly configurable and supports the following features:

- **Favorites**: Authors can favorite comments to highlight them.
- **Likes / Dislikes**: Users can express their opinions, with restrictions for logged-in users.
- **Replies**: Supports multi-depth replies for threaded discussions.
- **Moderation**: Comments can be moderated both in the backend and frontend.
- **Customizable Fields**: Additional title and Markdown-enabled body for comments.
- **Guest Information**: Guests must provide a username and email address.
- **Terms of Service**: A checkbox with a link to a CMS or static page for agreement.
- **Honeypot and Captcha**: Optional fields (using Gregwar Captcha) to prevent spam, applicable for guests only.
- **Hide on Dislike Ratio**: Option to hide comments based on dislike ratios.
- **Single Post Configuration**: Option to hide or close comments on a per-post basis.

The comments system distinguishes between guests, frontend users, and backend users:

- **Guests**: Required to fill out the username, email address, and terms of service checkbox. 
They are subject to the Honeypot and Captcha fields when enabled.
- **Logged-In Users**: Can enter comments directly without the need for Honeypot or Captcha. Their 
comments can also be set to be approved automatically.
- **Backend Users**: Have the ability to view and moderate pending comments on the single post page. 
Post authors can favorite comments, which pins or highlights them in the comments list. Moderation 
can also be conducted through October's backend interface, provided the necessary permissions are 
granted.

Comments can be accessed directly on the post model using `bloghub.comments` or 
`bloghub.comments_count`, or by utilizing one of the available template components, as described 
below.

## 4. Blog Meta
Each blog post can be enriched with additional meta fields to provide specific data for frontend 
templating or to set SEO-related values. Meta fields can be defined in two ways:

1. **Template's `theme.yaml` File**: This method is intended for template designers to provide 
pre-defined and implemented meta fields.
2. **Custom Meta Fields Settings Page**: This option is designed for administrators to define a 
universally available set of meta fields, which must be implemented manually.

### 4.1. Create Meta Fields via `theme.yaml`
To create theme-related meta fields, you must define them in the template's `theme.yaml` file using 
October's [Form Fields definition syntax](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/element/definitions.html):

```yaml
# Your Theme Data

ratmd.bloghub:
  post:
    # Your Meta Data
```

### 4.2. Create Meta Fields via Backend
Global meta fields can be created on the "Custom Meta Fields" settings page. Here, you can define a 
custom meta name, specify the respective meta type, and configure the meta settings, again using 
October's [Form Fields definition syntax](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/element/definitions.html).

## 5. Blog Tags
The **BlogHub** extension offers enhanced functionality for blog tags, allowing you to create and 
assign tags dynamically to each blog post. Additionally, tags can be customized with various 
attributes, including:

- **Promotion Flag**: Indicates whether a tag is promoted.
- **Title**: A descriptive title for the tag.
- **Description**: A brief description to provide more context.
- **Color**: A color that visually represents the tag.

These attributes can be utilized by template designers to effectively highlight or describe tags and 
tag archive pages.

Assigned tags can be accessed directly on the post model using `bloghub.tags` or through one of the 
available template components described below. One of these components enables the creation of a tag 
archive page that supports multiple tag queries. When this feature is enabled, you can display posts 
that must contain all specified tags (e.g., `/blog/tag/tag1+tag2`) or posts that must contain any of
the provided tags (e.g., `/blog/tag/tag1,tag2`).

## 6. Template Components
The **BlogHub** OctoberCMS plugin provides a range of useful components for enhancing your blog 
functionality.

### 6.1. `[bloghubBase]`
The `[bloghubBase]` component **should** be included in all CMS layouts that display blog posts. 
This component provides the basic configuration for all BlogHub and RainLab.Blog components, 
including single archive pages. If this component is not set, default values (as listed below) will 
be used unless specified otherwise.

**Note**: This component does not provide a default template, as it is intended solely for 
configuring existing components. Attempting to use `{% component 'bloghubBase' %}` without proper 
setup will result in an error.

#### Component Arguments
The `[bloghubBase]` component accepts the following arguments: 

```ini
[bloghubBase]
archiveAuthor = 'blog/author'
archiveDate = 'blog/date'
archiveTag = 'blog/tag'

authorUseSlugOnly = 0
date404OnInvalid = 1
date404OnEmpty = 1
tagAllowMultiple = 0
```

##### Argument: `archiveAuthor`
Defines the CMS page used for author archives. Set this argument to `0` to disable author archive 
pages entirely.

##### Argument: `archiveDate`
Defines the CMS page used for date archives. Set this argument to `0` to disable date archive pages 
entirely.

##### Argument: `archiveTag`
Defines the CMS page used for tag archives. Set this argument to `0` to disable tag archive pages 
entirely.

##### Argument: `authorUseSlugOnly`
When set to `1`, the author archive page will only check the `author_slug` backend user column and 
skip the `login` column.

##### Argument: `date404OnInvalid`
Controls whether a 404 error should be thrown when an invalid date is passed (e.g., `2022-13-10`).

##### Argument: `date404OnEmpty`
Controls whether a 404 error should be thrown when a passed date contains no posts.

##### Argument: `tagAllowMultiple`
Enables the use of complex tag queries that involve multiple tags. When enabled, you can combine 
multiple tags using a comma to display posts that have **either** of the provided tags, or a plus to 
display posts that have **all** of them.

**Examples**:
- `http://domain.tld/blog/tag/tag1,tag2,tag3` - Posts must have **at least one** of the specified 
tags (either `tag1`, `tag2`, or `tag3`).
- `http://domain.tld/blog/tag/tag1+tag2+tag3` - Posts must have **all** of the specified tags 
(i.e., `tag1 AND tag2 AND tag3`).

#### Page Variables
This component adds the following page variable:

##### Variable: `bloghub_config`
The `bloghub_config` variable contains all configured arguments as described above.

### 6.2. `[bloghubPostsByAuthor]`
The `[bloghubPostsByAuthor]` component builds upon RainLab's `[blogPosts]` component as its base 
class. Therefore, all options listed below, except for `authorFilter`, are identical to those in the 
referenced class. For detailed information about the individual arguments, please refer to the 
RainLab extension documentation.

#### Component Arguments
This component provides the following arguments:

```ini
[bloghubPostsByAuthor]
pageNumber = '{{ :page }}'
categoryFilter = 
postsPerPage = 10
noPostsMessage = '...'
sortOrder = 'published_at desc'
categoryPage = 'blog/category'
postPage = 'blog/post'
exceptPost = 
exceptCategories =
authorFilter = '{{ :slug }}'
```

##### Argument: `authorFilter`
The `authorFilter` argument specifies the strict author slug or the desired URL parameter. The 
author slug can either be the `author_slug` set on the respective backend user or the `login` value 
(if `author_slug` is empty). However, this behavior can be disabled by the `[bloghubBase]` component, 
as described previously.

**Note**: For security reasons, it is highly recommended to set a unique `author_slug` for each 
backend user/author that differs from the login name. Failing to do so could expose the login name 
to brute-force or rainbow table attacks.

#### Page Variables
This component adds the following page variable:

##### Variable: `author`
The `author` page variable is injected into the page object and points to the BackendUser model. The 
**BlogHub** plugin extends the BackendUser model with several additional dynamic properties. For 
more details, see the "10. Extended User Model" section below.

### 6.3. `[bloghubPostsByCommentCount]`
The `[bloghubPostsByCommentCount]` component is based on RainLab's `[blogPosts]` component. Unlike 
the referenced class, this component does not extend the existing arguments; instead, it removes the 
`sortOrder` option and implements its own sorting method. For detailed information about the 
available arguments, please refer to the RainLab extension documentation.

#### Component Arguments
This component does not introduce any additional arguments. Below are the existing arguments 
inherited from the `[blogPosts]` component:

```ini
[bloghubPostsByCommentCount]
pageNumber = '{{ :page }}'
categoryFilter = 
postsPerPage = 10
noPostsMessage = '...'
categoryPage = 'blog/category'
postPage = 'blog/post'
exceptPost = 
exceptCategories =
```

#### Page Variables
This component does not add any additional page variables.

### 6.4. `[bloghubPostsByDate]`
The `[bloghubPostsByDate]` component is based on RainLab's `[blogPosts]` component, meaning that all 
options, except for `dateFilter`, are identical to those in the referenced class. For detailed 
information about the individual arguments, please refer to the RainLab extension documentation.

#### Component Arguments
This component provides the following arguments:

```ini
[bloghubPostsByDate]
pageNumber = '{{ :page }}'
categoryFilter = 
postsPerPage = 10
noPostsMessage = '...'
sortOrder = 'published_at desc'
categoryPage = 'blog/category'
postPage = 'blog/post'
exceptPost = 
exceptCategories =
dateFilter = '{{ :date }}'
```

##### Argument: `dateFilter`

This argument accepts a direct date string (as described below) or a desired URL parameter. If an 
invalid date or an empty date archive is encountered, a 404 error page will be displayed unless 
configured otherwise in `[bloghubBase]` (see above).

**Valid Date Formats:**

- **Year archive:** `Y` (e.g., `https://domain.tld/blog/date/2022`)
- **Month archive:** `Y-m` (e.g., `https://domain.tld/blog/date/2022-01`)
- **Week archive:** `Y_W` (e.g., `https://domain.tld/blog/date/2022_2`)
- **Day archive:** `Y-m-d` (e.g., `https://domain.tld/blog/date/2022-01-01`)

We recommend using the following URL parameter to get the year, month, and day archives working 
smoothly. While you can employ a more complex regular expression to evaluate the date string more 
precisely, this might unnecessarily complicate the implementation:

```ini
url = "/blog/date/:date|^\d{4}(\-\d{2}(\-\d{2}))?/:page?"
```

For the week archive, you can use the following configuration (note that a leading zero is not 
required):

```ini
url = "/blog/date/:date|^\d{4}(\-\d{2}(\-\d{2})|(\_\d{1,2}))?/:page?"
```

#### Page Variables
This component adds the following page variables:

##### Variable: `date`
The `date` variable is an array containing the evaluated and sanitized date values. Depending on the 
archive type, it may include `year`, `month`, `week`, and/or `day`.

##### Variable: `dateType`
The `dateType` variable is a simple string indicating which archive page or date type has been 
detected from the passed URL parameter. It will point to either `year`, `month`, `week`, or `day`.

##### Variable: `dateFormat`
The `dateFormat` variable contains a formatted date/time string based on the detected `dateType` 
evaluated from the passed URL parameter. The following formats are used for the respective date 
types:

- **dateType: `year`** - format: `Y` (e.g., `2022`)
- **dateType: `month`** - format: `F, Y` (e.g., `January, 2022`)
- **dateType: `week`** - format: `\WW, Y` (e.g., `W2, 2022`)
- **dateType: `day`** - format: `F, d. Y` (e.g., `January, 17. 2022`)

Please note that it is currently NOT possible to use custom date/time formats for the individual 
date types.

### 6.5. `[bloghubPostsByTag]`
The `[bloghubPostsByTag]` component is built on RainLab's `[blogPosts]` component, meaning that all 
options, except for `tagFilter`, are identical to those in the referenced class. For detailed 
information about the individual arguments, please refer to the RainLab extension documentation.

#### Component Arguments
This component provides the following arguments:

```ini
[bloghubPostsByTag]
pageNumber = '{{ :page }}'
categoryFilter = 
postsPerPage = 10
noPostsMessage = '...'
sortOrder = 'published_at desc'
categoryPage = 'blog/category'
postPage = 'blog/post'
exceptPost = 
exceptCategories =
tagFilter = '{{ :tag }}'
```

##### Argument: `tagFilter`
This argument accepts a direct tag query string or the desired URL parameter. When the 
`tagAllowMultiple` option is enabled in the `[bloghubBase]` component, you can pass multiple tags 
using the `+` character to include posts containing **all** specified tags, or the `,` character to 
include posts containing **at least one** of the tags. If none of the provided tag slugs exist, the 
component will return a 404 error page.

#### Page Variables
This component adds the following page variables:

##### Variable: `tag`
The `tag` variable contains the single tag class model when only one tag has been used for the 
generated archive page.

##### Variable: `tags`
The `tags` variable is an array of tag class models when more than one tag has been used for the 
generated archive page. Please note that multiple-tag archive pages are only available if the 
`tagAllowMultiple` option in the `[bloghubBase]` component has been set to true.

### 6.6. `[bloghubCommentList]`
The `[bloghubCommentList]` component displays a configurable list of comments.

#### Component Arguments
This component provides the following arguments:

```ini
[bloghubCommentList]
postPage = 
excludePosts = 
amount = 5
sortOrder = 'published_at desc'
onlyFavorites = 0
hideOnDislikes = 0
```

##### Argument: `postPage`
Specifies the desired post page, which is used for generating the post URLs.

##### Argument: `excludePosts`
Allows you to exclude one or more posts by their IDs or slugs, listed in a comma-separated format.

##### Argument: `amount`
Determines the number of comments to display.

##### Argument: `sortOrder`
Controls the sort order of the comments list. You can choose from the following values:

- `created_at DESC`: Shows the newest comments at the top (default).
- `created_at ASC`: Shows the oldest comments at the top.
- `likes DESC`: Shows the most-liked comments at the top.
- `likes ASC`: Shows the least-liked comments at the bottom.
- `dislikes DESC`: Shows the most-disliked comments at the top.
- `dislikes ASC`: Shows the least-disliked comments at the bottom.

##### Argument: `onlyFavorites`
When enabled, this option allows only favorite comments to be displayed in the list. The post author 
can favorite comments unless this feature is disabled via the BlogHub settings page.

##### Argument: `hideOnDislikes`
The `hideOnDislikes` argument lets you hide comments based on their dislike count. The default value 
is `false`, which disables this function entirely.

**Examples:**

- Hide all comments with 10 dislikes or more:
```ini
[bloghubCommentList]
hideOnDislikes = 10
```

- Hide all comments when the dislike count is double that of the like count:
```ini
[bloghubCommentList]
hideOnDislikes = :2
```

- Hide all comments when the dislike count is four times higher than the like count:
```ini
[bloghubCommentList]
hideOnDislikes = :4
```

#### Page Variables
This component adds the following page variable:

##### Variable: `comments`
The `comments` variable contains the main collection of the configured amount of comments.

### 6.7. `[bloghubCommentSection]`
The `[bloghubCommentSection]` component displays a comment list and a comment form on the single 
post CMS page. Although it is technically possible to use this component outside of its intended 
context by setting the respective arguments, this usage is not supported, untested, and may not 
function as expected.

#### Component Arguments
This component provides the following arguments:

```ini
[bloghubCommentSection]
postSlug = 
commentsPerPage = 10
pageNumber = 
sortOrder = 'published_at desc'
commentHierarchy = 1
commentsAnchor = 'comments'
pinFavorites = 0
hideOnDislikes = 0
formPosition = 'above'
disableForm = 0
```

##### Argument: `postSlug`
Allows you to pass a strict post slug or a URL parameter to distinguish the current post slug. If 
this value is empty (the default), the component will attempt to auto-detect the respective post 
slug using the `blogPost` argument and similar relationships.

##### Argument: `commentsPerPage`
Specifies the number of comments to show per page. The default value is set to 10.

##### Argument: `pageNumber`
Allows you to pass a strict page number or a URL parameter to determine the current page number. If 
this value is empty (default), it will use the `cpage` URL GET parameter as the page number.

##### Argument: `sortOrder`
Controls the sort order of the comments list. You can choose from the following values:

- `created_at DESC`: Shows the newest comments at the top (default).
- `created_at ASC`: Shows the oldest comments at the top.
- `likes DESC`: Shows the most-liked comments at the top.
- `likes ASC`: Shows the least-liked comments at the bottom.
- `dislikes DESC`: Shows the most-disliked comments at the top.
- `dislikes ASC`: Shows the least-disliked comments at the bottom.

##### Argument: `commentHierarchy`
Controls how the comment list is displayed. When enabled, replies are shown below their parent 
comments in a hierarchical structure. This option may significantly increase the height of the 
comment section, as the `commentsPerPage` argument does **not** account for nested comments. 
Disabling this option will display each comment in a single nested list with a "reply to" quotation 
above the comment content.

##### Argument: `pinFavorites`
Allows the post author to pin favorite comments at the top of the comments list, ensuring they are 
visible to all users. This feature can be disabled via the BlogHub settings page.

##### Argument: `hideOnDislikes`
This argument allows you to hide comments based on a specified number of dislikes or a relative dislike-to-like ratio. The default value is `false`, disabling this feature entirely.

**Examples:**

- Hide all comments with 10 dislikes or more:
```ini
[bloghubCommentSection]
hideOnDislikes = 10
```

- Hide comments when the dislike count is double that of the like count:
```ini
[bloghubCommentSection]
hideOnDislikes = :2
```

- Hide comments when the dislike count is four times higher than the like count:
```ini
[bloghubCommentSection]
hideOnDislikes = :4
```

##### Argument: `formPosition`
Sets the position of the comment form. You can place the comment form either `above` or `below` the 
comment list. The default value is `above`.

##### Argument: `disableForm`
Disables the comment form, regardless of the configuration set on the single post. This is useful 
for alternative post views where commenting is not permitted, but the list of comments should still 
be visible.

#### Page Variables
This component adds the following page variables:

##### Variable: `showComments`
A boolean indicating whether the comment section should be displayed.

tagPage = 'blog/tag'
onlyPromoted = false
amount = 5
```

##### Argument: `onlyPromoted`
A boolean value that determines whether to display only promoted tags. If set to `true`, only tags 
marked as promoted will be shown. The default value is `false`, which means all tags will be 
displayed.

##### Argument: `amount`
Defines the number of tags to display. The default value is `5`, but this can be adjusted to show 
more or fewer tags based on your preference.

#### Page Variables
This component adds the following page variables:

## 7. Additional Menus
_Coming Soon_

## 8. Additional Permissions
The **BlogHub** OctoberCMS plugin adds the following permissions to enhance the management of 
omments and tags within the blog:

### 8.1. `ratmd.bloghub.comments`
This permission allows access to the **Comments** side menu within the RainLab.Blog main menu. 
The **Comments** menu includes access to comment moderation features. Note that this permission 
is **not required** for accessing the BlogHub and BlogHub / Comments settings page, which require 
the default RainLab permission: `rainlab.blog.manage_settings`.

### 8.2. `ratmd.bloghub.comments.access_comments_settings`

options to change the visibility of the entire comment section as well as to modify the comment mode 
for individual posts.

### 8.3. `ratmd.bloghub.comments.moderate_comments`
Users with this permission can moderate comments both in the backend and on the frontend. This 
includes the ability to approve, reject, or mark pending comments as spam. Note that while frontend

capabilities, including changing the status of any comment.

### 8.6. `ratmd.bloghub.tags.promoted`
Users with this permission can set the **Promote** flag on individual tags using the additional
